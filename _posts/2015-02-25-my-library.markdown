My library is big. Very big. Much too big. It takes up a whole wall. Five rows of books stacked from one end to the other. "The most expensive wallpaper there is!" a friend of mine used to say. He was right. After a while, you just stare at it and donâ€™t even bother opening those books anymore. They just become part of the decoration. But when I bought them it was because I liked what was inside, the photos, the paintings. They talked to me, and I wanted to have them with me.

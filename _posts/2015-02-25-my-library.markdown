title: "My Library"
---

My library is big. Very big. Much too big. It takes up a whole wall. Five rows of books stacked from one end to the other. "The most expensive wallpaper there is!" a friend of mine used to say. He was right. After a while, you just stare at it and don’t even bother opening those books anymore. They just become part of the decoration. But when I bought them it was because I liked what was inside, the photos, the paintings. They talked to me, and I wanted to have them with me.  

I am part of the pre digital generation. I like to touch books, to go through the pages, to feel the paper, smell the ink. I like the tactile, physical experience of it. So even though it has been a nightmare to move them from one place to another, pack those boxes again and again, I’ve nevertheless always brought them along, everywhere I‘ve lived. 

So my library is a part of my life now. Along the years, I have fed it little by little, seen it grow, to eventually become this "Thing" I felt responsable for. My books are kind of like tattoos. Some may have faded away, some I may not be very proud of anymore, but every single one of them has meant something to me at some point. As such, they are intimate reminders of who I am, and where I come from. But like tattoos, they are also there to be seen, to be read and appreciated by others, and this is why I have decided to share those books with you through this blog.
